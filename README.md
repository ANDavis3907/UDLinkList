# UDLinkList
C Program will implement a user-defined linked list

About this Assignment
C is a general-purpose structured programming language. The best way to understand programming is to learn about flow, syntax, and debugging through practice. In this assignment, you will create a C program that incorporates elements you studied in this course.

Program Specifications
Your program will implement a user-defined (defined by you) linked list.
The minimum requirements of the linked list are:
Add or delete items at the beginning of the list (push and pop)
Remove items from the end of the list
Remove a specific item by index or by value
The program will be interactive. At a minimum, the end-user will be able to print the list to the screen and add and delete values using the methods above.
The user will be able to search the list for a particular value.
The user will be able to input values using a text file and output the list to a text file.
Functions are to be used where appropriate to produce readable, reusable code. Library functions and user-defined functions should be used where appropriate.
Readability
Use indentation and spacing consistently. (e.g., every line in a loop is indented to align)
Add whitespace to help separate parts of the code. (e.g., empty line after a loop, space after a semicolon in a loop, etc.)
Give meaningful names to variables. Variables named x, y, and z are not descriptive and give the reader no information about their purpose; instead use names like primary, max, and counter. Loop condition variables are an exception because they are contained to a single area of the code and have a universally known function, so naming with a single letter (i, j, etc.) is acceptable.
Code should be organized into functions to reduce duplicate lines of code. Function definitions should be contained in a single section at the beginning of the program. Functions, like variables, should have meaningful names.
Documentation
Add a comment block at the beginning to indicate the purpose of the program
Add comments before each structure, function definition, loop and update statement: A programmer taking over your work should be able to pick up the project without additional research
Use either /* and */, or // for comments (the style chosen is up to you)
Coding Practice/Efficiency
In addition to the items listed above, you should follow good coding practice. This includes:

Keep lines of code to a reasonable length
Use a non-proportional front (Courier, Consolas), so characters are evenly spaced
Functions should perform a single operation; don't cram all code into a single function
Do not use global variables
Eliminate warnings from the compiler, as well as errors
